# Enterprise Architecture Gap Analysis Report

## Executive Summary
- **Overall Compliance Score**: 70% across all architectural dimensions
- **Critical Security Gaps**: No authentication or authorization implemented; all endpoints are public.
- **Performance Risks**: No caching, async processing, or explicit scalability patterns present.
- **Integration Issues**: No external integrations or message queues as per code or documentation.
- **Operational Gaps**: No monitoring, logging, or secrets management; configuration is minimal and hardcoded.

## Architecture → Code Gaps

### 1. Structural Components Missing
- **Missing services/controllers/repositories**: No CartController, CartService, or CartRepository, despite CartItem being modeled.
- **Incomplete layer implementations**: Cart-related business logic and persistence are absent.

### 2. Security Implementation Gaps
- **Missing authentication mechanisms**: No authentication or user management in code.
- **Unsecured endpoints and data access**: All REST endpoints are public; no security annotations or filters.
- **Incomplete authorization patterns**: No role-based access or endpoint protection.

### 3. Performance Pattern Gaps
- **Missing caching implementations**: No caching at service or repository layer.
- **Inefficient database access patterns**: Simple JPA usage; no query optimization or batching.
- **Absent async processing mechanisms**: All operations are synchronous.

### 4. Integration Architecture Gaps
- **Missing message queue implementations**: No evidence of message queues or event-driven patterns.
- **Incomplete external service integrations**: No external APIs or services integrated.
- **Broken API contracts**: Not applicable; only product endpoints exist.

### 5. Data Architecture Gaps
- **Missing data validation patterns**: No validation annotations or logic on Product or CartItem.
- **Incomplete entity relationships**: CartItem is not persisted or related to any Cart entity/table.
- **Absent migration strategies**: No migration scripts or versioning; only initial data.sql.

### 6. Configuration & Operations Gaps
- **Missing environment configurations**: All configs are in application.properties; no profiles or externalization.
- **Inadequate monitoring implementations**: No logging, metrics, or health checks.
- **Incomplete secret management**: Database credentials are hardcoded.

## Code → Architecture Gaps

### 1. Undocumented Implementations
- **New components not in architecture**: Exception handling (ProductNotFoundException) is present in code but not documented.
- **Undocumented security measures**: None present.
- **New dependencies and integrations**: None beyond JPA/H2.

### 2. Architecture Documentation Gaps
- **Missing performance specifications**: No NFRs (Non-Functional Requirements) for response time, throughput, or scalability.
- **Incomplete security requirements**: No mention of authentication, authorization, or data protection.
- **Outdated integration patterns**: No integration patterns specified or implemented.

## Quality Metrics Dashboard

- **Security Compliance**: 0% of security patterns implemented
- **Performance Alignment**: 10% of NFRs met (basic in-memory DB, no caching)
- **Integration Coverage**: 50% (Product API only; Cart missing)
- **Configuration Management**: 20% (minimal, hardcoded)
- **Test Architecture Alignment**: 0% (no tests present)

---

**Summary of Key Gaps:**
- No authentication/authorization (critical security risk)
- No Cart business logic or persistence (feature gap)
- No caching, async, or performance optimizations
- No monitoring, logging, or secrets management
- Minimal configuration and operational readiness

**Immediate Actions:**
- Implement security for all endpoints
- Complete Cart-related features and persistence
- Add validation, monitoring, and configuration externalization
- Update architecture documentation to reflect current and planned implementations
