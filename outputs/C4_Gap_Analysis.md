### Matched Components

| Component Name           | Type        | Notes                                 | Related Rule(s) |
|-------------------------|-------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------|
| ShoppingCartController  | Controller  | Fully matches expected design         | R001, R002      |
| ShoppingCartService     | Service     | Correctly mediates between Controller and Repository | R003, R004      |
| ShoppingCartRepository  | Repository  | Implements data access as specified   | R005            |
| ShoppingCart            | Entity      | Entity fields and relationships match | R006            |
| CartItem                | Entity      | Entity present and mapped             | R006            |
| User                    | Entity      | User entity present and mapped        | R007            |

### Gaps & Missing Components

| Component Name        | Type        | Issue Description                                      | Related Rule(s) |
|----------------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| ShoppingCartUtils    | Utility     | Present in code but not mapped in architecture         | R008            |

### Suggested Remediations

| Area                 | Recommendation                                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ShoppingCartUtils    | Review `ShoppingCartUtils` and either document its architectural role or refactor as needed.  |
| DiscountPolicy       | Review `DiscountPolicy` and either document its architectural role or refactor as needed.      |

### Embedded Examples

#### Example Gap: ShoppingCartUtils Not Mapped

```java
// ShoppingCartUtils.java
public class ShoppingCartUtils {
    public static BigDecimal calculateTotal(List<CartItem> items) {
        // ... implementation ...
    }
}
```

#### Example Controller Class

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/cart")
public class ShoppingCartController {
    @Autowired
    private ShoppingCartService shoppingCartService;

    @PostMapping("/add")
    public ResponseEntity<?> addItem(@RequestBody CartItem item) {
        shoppingCartService.addItem(item);
        return ResponseEntity.ok().build();
    }

    @DeleteMapping("/remove")
    public ResponseEntity<?> removeItem(@RequestParam Long itemId) {
        shoppingCartService.removeItem(itemId);
        return ResponseEntity.ok().build();
    }
}
```

**Note:**  
- The above report is based on automated analysis of the codebase at [shopping-cart-app/src/main](https://github.com/saniyakapur39/shopping-cart-app/tree/main/src/main) and the architecture document at [shopping_cart_architecture.rtf](https://github.com/saniyakapur39/shopping-cart-app-inputs-outputs/blob/main/inputs/architecture_docs/shopping_cart_architecture.rtf).
- All major architectural chains (Controller → Service → Repository → Entity) are present and correctly implemented.
- Two utility/domain classes (`ShoppingCartUtils`, `DiscountPolicy`) are present in code but not mapped in the architecture; review and update the architecture or code as appropriate.
