# Architecture Conformance Analysis Report

**Executive Summary**

This report presents a comprehensive architecture conformance analysis of the `shopping-cart-app` codebase (https://github.com/saniyakapur39/shopping-cart-app/tree/main/src/main) against the provided architecture and class diagrams (https://github.com/saniyakapur39/shopping-cart-app-inputs-outputs/blob/main/inputs/architecture_docs/shopping_cart_architecture.rtf) and the YAML rule set (R001-R008). The analysis includes static inspection of code annotations, method and field introspection, and validation of structural and behavioral expectations, with detailed diagnostics, embedded code and diagram snippets, and coverage statistics.

| ShoppingCartRepository   | Repository  | Extends `JpaRepository<ShoppingCart, Long>`, provides DB access for ShoppingCart entity.                 | R003, R005        |
| ShoppingCart             | Entity      | Annotated with `@Entity`, has `@Id` field, contains `@OneToMany` relationship to CartItem.               | R004, R008        |
| CartItem                 | Entity      | Annotated with `@Entity`, has `@Id` field, references ShoppingCart via `@ManyToOne`.                    | R004, R008        |

  - Snippet:  
    ```java
    @RestController
    @RequestMapping("/cart")
    public class ShoppingCartController {
        private final ShoppingCartService shoppingCartService;
        // ...
    }
    ```
  - Compliance: Full
