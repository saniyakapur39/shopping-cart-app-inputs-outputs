# Architecture Conformance Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

The analysis could not be completed because the agent does not have direct access to read or extract information from the provided GitHub URLs for the codebase and architecture diagram. As a result, no architectural rules could be evaluated, and no matches or gaps could be identified. To proceed, please provide the actual code files and architecture diagram content directly.
