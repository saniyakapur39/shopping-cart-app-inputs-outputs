# Architecture Conformance Analysis Report

## Architecture Analysis Summary

- **Rules Evaluated:** R001 (Missing Controller), R002 (Missing Service Layer), R003 (Missing Repository), R004 (Missing Cart Domain Logic), R005 (Missing REST API for Cart), R006 (Entity Without Repository), R007 (Orphan Controller), R008 (Unlinked Entity)
- **Matches:** The codebase contains all expected Controllers, Services, Repositories, and Entities as typically required for a shopping cart application. Annotations and relationships are present and follow standard Spring Boot conventions.
- **Gaps Found:** Unable to evaluate gaps against the architecture and class diagrams because the .rtf document content was not accessible. No code-level gaps detected based on standard expectations.

### Matched Components

| Component Name        | Type         | Notes                                                                                                         | Related Rule(s) |
|----------------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| CartController       | Controller   | Annotated with @RestController, delegates to CartService, endpoints for add, get, remove cart items           | R001, R005, R007|
| ProductController    | Controller   | Annotated with @RestController, delegates to ProductService, endpoints for add, get products                  | R001, R007      |
| CartService          | Service      | Annotated with @Service, encapsulates business logic for cart, uses CartRepository                            | R002, R004      |
| ProductService       | Service      | Annotated with @Service, encapsulates business logic for products, uses ProductRepository                     | R002            |
| CartRepository       | Repository   | Interface, extends JpaRepository<Cart, Long>, annotated with @Repository                                      | R003, R006      |
| ProductRepository    | Repository   | Interface, extends JpaRepository<Product, Long>, annotated with @Repository                                   | R003, R006      |
| Cart                 | Entity       | Annotated with @Entity, has id, productId, quantity fields                                                    | R006, R008      |
| Product              | Entity       | Annotated with @Entity, has id, name, price fields                                                            | R006, R008      |

### Gaps & Missing Components

| Component Name | Type | Issue Description | Related Rule(s) |
|----------------|------|-------------------|-----------------|
| (None detected in code) |      | Unable to check for diagram/code mismatches due to inaccessible architecture document | All |

---

### Suggested Remediations

| Area | Recommendation |
|------|----------------|
| Architecture Document Access | Ensure the architecture and class diagrams (.rtf) are accessible and their content is provided for a complete conformance analysis. This will allow for precise matching of code to architectural expectations. |
| Coverage Validation | After obtaining the architecture diagrams, re-run the analysis to check for any mismatches, missing relationships, or incomplete logic as per the diagrams. |
| Documentation | Embed code snippets and diagram fragments in future reports to illustrate findings and facilitate remediation. |

---

### Coverage Statistics

- **Codebase Coverage:** 100% of the Java source files under `src/main/java/com/shoppingcart/` were analyzed.
- **Diagram Coverage:** 0% (architecture and class diagrams not accessible; unable to parse or analyze .rtf content).
- **Skipped/Unreadable:** Entire architecture diagram (.rtf) was skipped due to access limitations. No code files were skipped.

### Diagnostic Details & Snippets

#### Example: CartController.java
```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/cart")
public class CartController {
    @Autowired
    private CartService cartService;
    // ...
}
```
- **Annotations:** @RestController, @Autowired
- **Complies:** Fully with expected design for a REST controller.

#### Example: CartService.java
```java
@Service
public class CartService {
    @Autowired
    private CartRepository cartRepository;
    // ...
}
```
- **Annotations:** @Service, @Autowired
- **Complies:** Fully with expected service layer design.

#### Example: CartRepository.java
```java
@Repository
public interface CartRepository extends JpaRepository<Cart, Long> { }
```
- **Annotations:** @Repository
- **Complies:** Fully with expected repository pattern.

**Note:** For a complete and precise architecture conformance analysis, please provide the content of the architecture and class diagrams (.rtf). This will enable rule-by-rule validation and identification of any diagram/code mismatches or missing components.
