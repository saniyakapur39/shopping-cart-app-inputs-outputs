# Architecture Conformance Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

The shopping cart application demonstrates strong adherence to the basic layered architecture pattern (Controller-Service-Repository) for the Cart and Product domains. All core components are properly annotated and follow expected relationships. However, there are significant gaps between the implemented monolithic application and the microservices architecture described in the documentation. Key missing components include the Order Service, Authentication Service, API Gateway, and Message Broker integration. The application also lacks JWT authentication as specified in the security requirements.

**Major Gaps:**
1. Monolithic structure instead of microservices architecture
2. Missing JWT authentication and security implementation
3. Missing Order Service, API Gateway, and Message Broker
4. No evidence of containerization or Kubernetes deployment

**Key Recommendations:**
1. Refactor the application into separate microservices
2. Implement JWT authentication for secure endpoints
3. Develop the missing Order Service with proper integration
4. Implement an API Gateway for request routing
5. Integrate a Message Broker for asynchronous communication

### Gaps & Missing Components

| Component Name | Type | Related Rule(s) | Issue Description |
|----------------|------|----------------|-------------------|
| Microservices Architecture | Architecture | N/A | Codebase is structured as a monolith rather than separate microservices. All components are in a single package structure. |
| JWT Authentication | Security | N/A | No implementation of JWT token generation, validation, or security configuration found in the codebase. |
| Order Service | Service | N/A | No OrderController, OrderService, or OrderRepository found despite being specified in the architecture documentation. |
| API Gateway | Infrastructure | N/A | No API Gateway implementation to route requests to appropriate services. |
| Message Broker | Infrastructure | N/A | No integration with RabbitMQ, Kafka, or any message broker for asynchronous communication. |

---

### Suggested Remediations

| Area | Recommendation |
|------|----------------|
| Microservices Architecture | Refactor the codebase into separate microservices, each with its own bounded context. Create separate projects for `/services/cart-service/`, `/services/order-service/`, and `/services/user-service/`. Each service should have its own controllers, services, repositories, and database connection. |
| JWT Authentication | Create a new `/services/user-service/middleware/auth.js` file to implement JWT verification logic. Update controllers to use this middleware for protected endpoints. Implement token generation in authentication flows. |
| Order Service | Develop a complete Order Service with `/services/order-service/controllers/OrderController.java`, `/services/order-service/services/OrderService.java`, and `/services/order-service/repositories/OrderRepository.java`. Implement endpoints for order creation, status updates, and history. |
| API Gateway | Create a new API Gateway project (`/api-gateway/`) that routes requests to the appropriate microservices. Implement routing logic for cart, product, order, and user endpoints. |
| Message Broker | Integrate a message broker (RabbitMQ or Kafka) for asynchronous communication between services. Create `/services/order-service/messaging/producer.java` and corresponding consumers in relevant services. Publish events for order creation, status changes, and inventory updates. |

### Code Snippets and Examples

**Current Cart-Product Relationship (Properly Implemented):**
```java
// In Cart.java
@ManyToMany
@JoinTable(
    name = "cart_products",
    joinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "cart_id"),
    inverseJoinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "product_id")
)
private Set<Product> products = new HashSet<>();
```

**Missing JWT Authentication (Example Implementation):**
```java
// Example JWT filter that should be implemented
public class JwtAuthenticationFilter extends OncePerRequestFilter {
    @Override
    protected void doFilterInternal(HttpServletRequest request, 
                                   HttpServletResponse response, 
                                   FilterChain filterChain) throws ServletException, IOException {
        // Extract JWT token from request
        // Validate token
        // Set authentication in SecurityContext
        filterChain.doFilter(request, response);
    }
}
```

**Missing Order Service (Example Implementation):**
```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/orders")
public class OrderController {
    @Autowired
    private OrderService orderService;
    
    @PostMapping
    public Order createOrder(@RequestBody OrderRequest request) {
        return orderService.createOrder(request);
    }
    
    @GetMapping("/{id}")
    public Order getOrder(@PathVariable Long id) {
        return orderService.getOrderById(id);
    }
}
```

### Coverage Statistics

- **Components Analyzed:** 8/8 (100%)
- **Files Analyzed:** 8/8 (100%)
- **Architecture Requirements Covered:** 3/8 (37.5%)

The analysis successfully covered all provided code files. However, the architecture documentation specifies several components that are not present in the codebase, resulting in lower overall architecture coverage.

### Conclusion

The shopping cart application implements a solid foundation with proper Controller-Service-Repository patterns for Cart and Product domains. However, significant architectural gaps exist between the current monolithic implementation and the microservices architecture specified in the documentation. To align with the architecture, the application needs to be refactored into separate microservices, with additional components implemented for security, order management, API gateway, and asynchronous communication.
