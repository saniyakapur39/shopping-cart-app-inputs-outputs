### Matched Components

| Component Name | Type | Notes | Related Rule(s) |
|----------------|------|-------|-----------------|

| ProductController | Controller | Implements REST endpoints for product operations | R001 |
| CartService | Service | Encapsulates business logic for cart operations | R002, R004 |
| ProductService | Service | Encapsulates business logic for product operations | R002 |
| CartRepository | Repository | Extends JpaRepository for Cart entity persistence | R003, R006 |
| ProductRepository | Repository | Extends JpaRepository for Product entity persistence | R003, R006 |
| Cart | Entity | Contains methods for adding, removing, and clearing products | R004 |
| Product | Entity | Represents product information | R006 |

### Gaps & Missing Components

| Component Name | Type | Issue Description | Related Rule(s) |
|----------------|------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Cart-Product Relationship | Entity Relationship | The Cart entity uses a Map<Long, Integer> to track products instead of proper JPA relationships | R008 |
| CartItem | Entity | Missing entity to properly represent the relationship between Cart and Product | R008 |

---

### Suggested Remediations

| Area | Recommendation |
|------|----------------|
| Entity Relationships | Refactor the Cart entity to use proper JPA relationships instead of Map<Long, Integer>. Introduce a CartItem entity with @ManyToOne relationships to both Cart and Product entities, and include a quantity field. |
| CartItem Implementation | Create a new CartItem class with @Entity annotation, an ID field, @ManyToOne relationships to Cart and Product, and a quantity field. Update Cart to use @OneToMany relationship to CartItem. |
| Service Layer Update | Update CartService to work with the new entity relationship model, ensuring methods like addProductToCart and removeProductFromCart operate on CartItem entities. |
