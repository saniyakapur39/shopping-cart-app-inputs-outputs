# Architecture Conformance Analysis Report  
**Application:** Shopping Cart Application  
**Date:** [Hypothetical Date]  
**Analyst:** [Your Name]

## 1. Executive Summary

This report presents a comprehensive architecture conformance analysis of the hypothetical Shopping Cart Application. The assessment evaluates the alignment between the intended architecture (as inferred from typical e-commerce system diagrams) and the actual codebase, focusing on critical architectural rules. The analysis reveals several well-implemented components, such as the Product and User modules, but also identifies significant gaps, particularly in the Cart and Service layers. Actionable remediation steps are provided to address these discrepancies and improve overall architectural compliance.

## 2. Detailed Analysis of Architectural Rules

| Rule ID | Description | Status | Diagnostic Details |
|---------|-------------|--------|--------------------|
| R001    | Missing Controller: Architecture diagram contains Controller, but codebase lacks `@RestController` | **Fail** | CartController is present in the diagram but missing in codebase. ProductController and UserController are present. |
| R002    | Missing Service Layer: Diagram contains Service, but codebase lacks `@Service` | **Partial Pass** | ProductService and UserService are present. CartService is missing. |
| R003    | Missing Repository: Diagram contains Repository, but codebase lacks `JpaRepository` | **Pass** | ProductRepository, UserRepository, and OrderRepository are implemented. |
| R004    | Missing Cart Domain Logic: Class diagram expects Cart/CartItem, but codebase lacks CartService | **Fail** | Cart and CartItem entities exist, but CartService is missing. |
| R005    | Missing REST API for Cart: Diagram contains CartController, but codebase lacks it | **Fail** | CartController is not implemented. |
| R006    | Entity Without Repository: Codebase has `@Entity` but no corresponding `JpaRepository` | **Fail** | Cart and CartItem entities exist, but no CartRepository or CartItemRepository. |
| R007    | Orphan Controller: Codebase has `@RestController` but does not reference `@Service` | **Pass** | All controllers reference their respective services, except CartController, which is missing. |
| R008    | Unlinked Entity: Class diagram expects relationships, but entity is isolated | **Partial Pass** | CartItem is linked to Cart and Product. Order is linked to User and Cart. However, Address entity is isolated. |

### Suggested Remediations

| Area                | Recommendation                                                                 |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Cart Controller     | Implement CartController with `@RestController` annotation and endpoints for cart operations (add item, remove item, view cart, checkout). Reference CartService for business logic. |
| Cart Service        | Create CartService class with `@Service` annotation to encapsulate all cart-related business logic. |
| Cart Repositories   | Define CartRepository and CartItemRepository interfaces extending JpaRepository to enable persistence and querying of cart data. |
| Address Entity      | Add relationships to User or Order entities using `@ManyToOne` or `@OneToOne` annotations to link Address with other entities. |
| Controller-Service Pattern | Review all controllers to ensure they reference services, not repositories or entities directly, maintaining proper separation of concerns. |
