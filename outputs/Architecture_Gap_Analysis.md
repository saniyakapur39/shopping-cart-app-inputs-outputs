# Architecture-Code Gap Analysis Report for Shopping Cart App

## Executive Summary
- **Overall Compliance Score**: Unable to compute due to lack of direct access to codebase and architecture document files.
- **Critical Security Gaps**: Analysis not possible without code and documentation.
- **Performance Risks**: Analysis not possible without code and documentation.
- **Integration Issues**: Analysis not possible without code and documentation.
- **Operational Gaps**: Analysis not possible without code and documentation.

## Architecture → Code Gaps

### 1. Structural Components Missing
- Unable to determine missing services/controllers/repositories or incomplete layer implementations without code and architecture document.

### 2. Security Implementation Gaps
- Unable to assess authentication mechanisms, unsecured endpoints, or authorization patterns without code and architecture document.

### 3. Performance Pattern Gaps
- Unable to assess caching, database access, or async processing without code and architecture document.

### 4. Integration Architecture Gaps
- Unable to assess message queue implementations, external service integrations, or API contracts without code and architecture document.

### 5. Data Architecture Gaps
- Unable to assess data validation, entity relationships, or migration strategies without code and architecture document.

### 6. Configuration & Operations Gaps
- Unable to assess environment configurations, monitoring, or secret management without code and architecture document.

## Code → Architecture Gaps

### 1. Undocumented Implementations
- Unable to determine new components, security measures, or integrations not in architecture without code and architecture document.

### 2. Architecture Documentation Gaps
- Unable to determine missing performance specifications, security requirements, or outdated integration patterns without code and architecture document.
