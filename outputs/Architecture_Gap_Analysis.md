The shopping cart application shows significant gaps between the architectural vision and implementation, particularly in security, performance optimization, and operational aspects. While the core shopping functionality is present, many of the supporting services and quality attributes specified in the architecture are either missing or incompletely implemented. Immediate attention should be given to security gaps and performance optimizations to ensure system stability and data protection. A phased approach to addressing the remaining gaps is recommended, with clear prioritization based on business impact and technical risk.
