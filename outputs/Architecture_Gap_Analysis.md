# Architecture-Code Gap Analysis Report for Shopping Cart App

The codebase analysis for the shopping-cart-app has been completed, covering all required architectural dimensions. However, the architecture diagram file (shopping_cart_architecture.rtf) could not be directly parsed from the repository using available tools. To proceed with a comprehensive gap analysis and deliver the full report as per your criteria, please provide the content of shopping_cart_architecture.rtf (either by pasting the text or sharing the diagram details).

Once the architecture diagram content is provided, I will:
- Extract and summarize all architectural dimensions from the document
- Compare them with the codebase analysis
- Deliver the full Architecture-Code Gap Analysis Report, including Executive Summary, detailed gap tables, recommendations, impact matrix, and quality metrics dashboard

**Next Step:**  
Please provide the content of shopping_cart_architecture.rtf so the analysis can be completed.
