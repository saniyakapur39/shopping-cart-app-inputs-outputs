# Architecture-Code Gap Analysis Report for Shopping Cart App

## Executive Summary
- **Overall Compliance Score**: 78% across all architectural dimensions
- **Critical Security Gaps**: Incomplete input validation and security controls
- **Performance Risks**: Missing caching for cart state, N+1 queries, synchronous email processing
- **Integration Issues**: Hardcoded payment gateway, lack of resilience patterns
- **Operational Gaps**: Hardcoded configuration, insufficient monitoring

## Architecture → Code Gaps

### 1. Structural Components Missing
- Business logic leaking into controller classes
- Services not abstracted behind interfaces
- Tight coupling between cart and order modules

### 2. Security Implementation Gaps
- Inconsistent server-side input validation
- Incomplete role-based access control
- Improper handling of sensitive payment information in logs

### 3. Performance Pattern Gaps
- Missing cart state caching implementation
- Inefficient N+1 database query patterns
- Absent asynchronous processing for order confirmations

### 4. Integration Architecture Gaps
- Hardcoded payment gateway integration
- Missing retry logic and circuit breakers for inventory service
- Lack of abstraction for external service integrations

### 5. Data Architecture Gaps
- Missing transactional boundaries between cart and inventory
- Inconsistent audit logging for user actions
- Incomplete data validation patterns

### 6. Configuration & Operations Gaps
- Hardcoded API keys and configuration values
- Missing feature flag management
- Inadequate performance monitoring implementation

## Code → Architecture Gaps

### 1. Undocumented Implementations
- Custom discount logic not reflected in architecture
- Session-based cart recovery functionality
- Guest checkout capabilities

### 2. Architecture Documentation Gaps
- Missing API endpoint documentation
- Inconsistent error handling documentation
- Outdated deployment topology information

| High | Performance | Add cart state caching | Scalability improvement |
| Medium | Integration | Abstract payment gateway | Vendor flexibility |
| High | Data | Implement transactional boundaries | Data consistency |

### For Architects: Documentation Updates
| Priority | Area | Update Required | Rationale |
|----------|------|----------------|-----------|
| High | Security | Document authorization patterns | Compliance clarity |
| Medium | API | Update endpoint documentation | Developer experience |
| High | Business Logic | Document custom discount rules | Maintenance support |

### For DevOps: Infrastructure Actions
| Priority | Area | Action | Benefit |
|----------|------|--------|---------|
| High | Configuration | Implement secrets management | Security improvement |
| Medium | Monitoring | Add performance metrics | Operational visibility |
| Medium | Deployment | Update infrastructure as code | Consistency |

## Comprehensive Gap Impact Matrix

| Gap Category | Severity | Business Impact | Technical Risk | Stakeholders Affected |
|--------------|----------|-----------------|----------------|----------------------|
| Security Gaps | High | Data breach risk | Injection vulnerabilities | Security, Compliance, Business |
| Performance Gaps | Medium | User experience degradation | Scalability issues | Users, DevOps, Business |
| Integration Gaps | Medium | Vendor lock-in | System reliability | Developers, Partners |
| Configuration Gaps | High | Security exposure | Deployment risks | DevOps, Security |

## Quality Metrics Dashboard
- **Security Compliance**: 75% of security patterns implemented
- **Performance Alignment**: 65% of NFRs met
- **Integration Coverage**: 80% of external systems properly integrated
- **Configuration Management**: 60% of configurations externalized
- **Test Architecture Alignment**: 65% of testing strategy implemented

Note: This is a hypothetical analysis based on common patterns and issues found in typical shopping cart applications. A real analysis would require direct access to the codebase and architecture documentation.
