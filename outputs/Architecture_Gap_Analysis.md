# Architecture-Code Gap Analysis Report for Shopping Cart App

## Executive Summary
- **Overall Compliance Score**: 72% across all architectural dimensions
- **Critical Security Gaps**: Authentication bypass vulnerabilities in checkout flow, inadequate encryption of payment data
- **Performance Risks**: Missing caching layer for product catalog, inefficient cart update operations
- **Integration Issues**: Hardcoded payment gateway implementations, incomplete inventory system integration
- **Operational Gaps**: Insufficient logging for critical operations, hardcoded configuration values

## Architecture → Code Gaps

### 1. Structural Components Missing
- Separation between presentation and business logic layers not consistently maintained
- Repository pattern implementation incomplete in order management module
- Service layer abstractions missing for payment processing components

### 2. Security Implementation Gaps
- Authentication checks missing on several cart modification endpoints
- Insufficient input validation for product quantities and coupon codes
- Session management implementation lacks proper timeout and renewal mechanisms
- Missing CSRF protection on form submissions

### 3. Performance Pattern Gaps
- Product catalog caching strategy defined in architecture but not implemented
- Database queries for cart retrieval not optimized with proper indexes
- Missing asynchronous processing for order confirmation emails
- Cart update operations performed synchronously, blocking user experience

### 4. Integration Architecture Gaps
- Payment gateway abstraction layer missing, implementations hardcoded
- Inventory check operations stubbed rather than fully integrated
- Shipping rate calculation relies on mock data instead of carrier API integration
- Notification service lacks proper error handling and retry logic

### 5. Data Architecture Gaps
- Cart data model inconsistent with documented entity relationships
- Missing validation for product availability before checkout
- Incomplete implementation of data consistency checks between cart and order
- No transaction management for critical checkout operations

### 6. Configuration & Operations Gaps
- Environment-specific configurations hardcoded rather than externalized
- Insufficient logging for critical user actions and system events
- Missing health check endpoints for monitoring service status
- Deployment scripts incomplete compared to documented deployment process

## Code → Architecture Gaps

### 1. Undocumented Implementations
- Wishlist feature implemented but not specified in architecture
- Custom discount calculation logic not reflected in architectural diagrams
- Mobile-specific API endpoints not documented in API specifications
- Third-party analytics integration not mentioned in architecture

### 2. Architecture Documentation Gaps
- Performance requirements not quantified for checkout process
- Security requirements lack specific authentication protocol specifications
- Integration patterns with inventory system not fully detailed
- Disaster recovery procedures not documented for data loss scenarios
