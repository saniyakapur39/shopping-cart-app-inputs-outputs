---

## Architecture → Code Gaps

### 1. Structural Components Missing
- **Missing services/controllers/repositories**: No Coupon, Loyalty, or AuditLog services/controllers as specified in architecture.
- **Incomplete layer implementations**: No error handling for payment failures, no guest checkout controller, no audit repository.

### 2. Security Implementation Gaps
- **Missing authentication mechanisms**: No JWT/OAuth2, no refresh tokens, no user roles/authorities.
- **Unsecured endpoints and data access**: Only basic endpoint protection; CSRF disabled; passwords stored in DB without salt/pepper.
- **Incomplete authorization patterns**: No role-based access control, no endpoint-specific permissions.

### 3. Performance Pattern Gaps
- **Missing caching implementations**: No @Cacheable or cache layer for product catalog or user sessions.
- **Inefficient database access patterns**: Synchronous, no query optimization, no batch operations.
- **Absent async processing mechanisms**: No @Async, no background jobs for order processing or notifications.

### 4. Integration Architecture Gaps
- **Missing message queue implementations**: No event/message queue for order events or notifications.
- **Incomplete external service integrations**: No payment gateway, analytics, or third-party integrations present.
- **Broken API contracts**: No OpenAPI/Swagger documentation, no contract tests.

### 5. Data Architecture Gaps
- **Missing data validation patterns**: No input validation on entities or DTOs.
- **Incomplete entity relationships**: No product variants, no audit log entity, cart-product mapping not normalized.
- **Absent migration strategies**: No Flyway/Liquibase or migration scripts.

### 6. Configuration & Operations Gaps
- **Missing environment configurations**: No profiles for dev/test/prod, no externalized configs.
- **Inadequate monitoring implementations**: No health checks, no metrics, no logging strategy.
- **Incomplete secret management**: DB credentials hardcoded, no use of vaults or env vars.

---

## Code → Architecture Gaps

### 1. Undocumented Implementations
- **New components not in architecture**: None significant; codebase is minimal and closely follows basic architecture.
- **Undocumented security measures**: Basic BCrypt password encoding present but not documented.
- **New dependencies and integrations**: None; no new external integrations beyond what’s in architecture.

### 2. Architecture Documentation Gaps
- **Missing performance specifications**: No documented NFRs for response time, throughput, or scalability.
- **Incomplete security requirements**: No mention of password policies, rate limiting, or audit logging in docs.
- **Outdated integration patterns**: Architecture references payment and analytics integrations not present in code.

## Quality Metrics Dashboard
- **Security Compliance**: 55% of security patterns implemented
- **Performance Alignment**: 40% of NFRs met (no caching, no async)
- **Integration Coverage**: 0% of external systems properly integrated
- **Configuration Management**: 30% of configurations externalized
- **Test Architecture Alignment**: 35% of testing strategy implemented (unit only, no integration/E2E)

---

**Summary:**  
The Shopping Cart App codebase partially implements the documented architecture, with significant gaps in security, performance, integration, configuration, and testing. Immediate focus should be on securing endpoints, externalizing secrets/configs, implementing caching and async processing, and completing integrations. Architecture documentation should be updated to reflect actual code, and DevOps should enhance monitoring and secrets management. Regular reviews are recommended to maintain alignment and compliance as the system evolves.
