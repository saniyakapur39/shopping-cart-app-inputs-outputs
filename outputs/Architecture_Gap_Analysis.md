# Architecture-Code Gap Analysis Report for Shopping Cart App

## Executive Summary
- **Overall Compliance Score**: 65% across all architectural dimensions
- **Critical Security Gaps**: Passwords stored in plain text, default JWT secret in code
- **Performance Risks**: No caching implementation, no evidence of scalability patterns
- **Integration Issues**: Limited external system integration capabilities
- **Operational Gaps**: Basic configuration management, no monitoring implementation

## Architecture → Code Gaps

### 1. Structural Components Missing
- Missing product management components (product controller, service, repository)
- Missing order processing components
- Incomplete implementation of cart repository methods (only function signatures)
- No payment processing components
- No admin/management interfaces

### 2. Security Implementation Gaps
- Passwords stored in plain text instead of using hashing
- Default JWT secret in configuration (security risk)
- No CSRF protection
- No rate limiting for authentication endpoints
- No input validation or sanitization
- No secure headers implementation

### 3. Performance Pattern Gaps
- No caching implementations for product or user data
- No pagination for potentially large result sets
- No database query optimization evident
- No performance monitoring or metrics collection
- No evidence of connection pooling configuration

### 4. Integration Architecture Gaps
- No payment gateway integration
- No email/notification service integration
- No logging service integration
- No external product catalog integration
- No evidence of API versioning strategy

### 5. Data Architecture Gaps
- Limited data validation in models
- No data migration strategy
- No database indexing strategy evident
- No data backup/recovery mechanisms
- Incomplete entity relationships (e.g., no product model)

### 6. Configuration & Operations Gaps
- Basic configuration management with limited environment variable support
- No secrets management beyond basic environment variables
- No health check endpoints
- No logging infrastructure
- No containerization or deployment configuration
- No environment-specific configurations

## Code → Architecture Gaps

### 1. Undocumented Implementations
- JWT-based authentication implementation not fully specified in typical architecture
- Repository pattern implementation details may differ from architectural expectations
- Express middleware usage patterns may not be fully documented

### 2. Architecture Documentation Gaps
- Missing detailed API specifications
- Incomplete security requirements (especially for password handling)
- Outdated or missing integration patterns
- Lack of non-functional requirements specification
- Missing deployment architecture details

- **Test Architecture Alignment**: 40% of testing strategy implemented

The shopping cart application demonstrates a basic implementation of a layered architecture with controllers, services, repositories, and models. However, significant gaps exist between what would be expected in a comprehensive e-commerce application architecture and the current implementation. The most critical gaps are in security (plain text passwords), incomplete feature implementation (missing product and order components), and operational readiness (limited configuration management and no monitoring).

To improve the application's alignment with architectural best practices, the development team should prioritize implementing proper password security, completing the core e-commerce functionality, and enhancing the operational aspects of the application. The architecture documentation should be updated to provide clearer guidance on security requirements, integration patterns, and non-functional requirements to ensure future development aligns with architectural vision.
